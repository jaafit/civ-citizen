Played 0.2 with Vivi and Kyle.  Lots of feedback..  Neither liked that contracts cancel abilities.  So I'm taking that out.  I might later add some powerful abilities that go away with contract.  There are events that benefit uncontracted businesses.  I also totally revamped the close business mechanic.  You can discard contracts at the end of the round.  On your turn, you can close an uncontracted business as an action.

Played 0.1 a couple times.  I want there to be an arc where players can either try to get good uncontracted businesses and keep the treasury empty, or go for contracted business and keep treasury full (big gov vs small gov).
