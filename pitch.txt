<Laying out the 4 ages>
Treasury is a civ builder in which you are an entrepreneur instead of a ruler.  You're building a shared civilization with your opponents, competing to provide what's most in demand.
There are 95 unique cards spanning 4 ages.  Each card looks like this
Show Prophet
Play the top half, and you've started a business that not only provides a resource <point>, but also grants you a new ability <point>.
<Draw and show Discovery>
Play the bottom half, and you've both triggered an event <point> and created demand.  This demand grows as more events happen.
<Fan out food/happy/hides demand>
And is met, when you can provide a matching resource.
<Take discovery>
If you've met some demand, you'll earn gold at the end of each age.
Naturally, there is a progression through the ages.
<Flip Foundry>
Events are more powerful
Businesses get more expensive, provide more, and earn more.
<Start flipping Trapper, Smuggler, Merchant>
Now while it may sound simple enough to just play matching cards, there is a limited amount of money in the treasury, the player who's hoping to sooth an angry populace <point to Merchant> is also the one sending barbarians to plunder the contract money.  You can mitigate this by
<flip warrior onto their side>
providing weapons to the civilization.  Each weapon reduces the amount stolen, and helps create an environment for the more peaceful providers to flourish.
Science providers generally help draw better cards, while food providers spend cards for free actions.  So you want to find a balance.  Each age also has its own unique resource <flip Tailor, Masonry, Smelter> (hides, stone, bronze, iron) and if the treasury is intact, that's where the big money is.
The player with the most money wins.
