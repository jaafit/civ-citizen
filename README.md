**Treasury: Rules**

In Treasury, you are a citizen helping to build a civilization by providing what the population demands while also influencing events.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

On your turn, you can play a card either to start a business (top half of the card) or trigger the current event (bottom half).  

After an event is resolved, it goes into the demand pile to indicate a resource the civilization is now in need of.  

Each business provides a number of resources shown in the top-left.  To earn a contract, the demand pile must have all the resources that a business provides.  If that's the case, the owner may claim a contract on their turn.  At the end of each age, they'll earn money for that business.

**Setup:**

Put 2g per player into the treasury.  Give 2g to the 1st player, 3g to the 2nd player, etc

With the Age [] cards:
* Deal 5 to each player.
* Put cards equal to the number of players into the current event pile face-up.  Splay them so names and icons of all cards are visible.  
* Stack 4 cards per player to form the draw pile.  In 4p, only use 3 per player.
* Put the remaining Age [] cards away.

With the other cards, separate them by age to make a face-down draw pile for each later age. 

**On your turn**, you must choose one action:
* Trigger an event
* Start a business
* Develop a business
* Sell a business

**Trigger an event:**
* Place a card face-up on top of the event pile, partially covering the event below.  This card can come from your hand or from the draw pile.
* Completely resolve the top card of the event pile.  Events involving players are resolved in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the current player.
* Then place the card face-up on top of the demand pile.

**Start a business:**
* Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you. 

**Develop a business:**
* Place any number of cards from your hand face-down on top of a face-down business.
* On your next turn, you may open the business if it has enough development cards.

**Sell a business:**
* Discard a business and its contract.  Gain 1g if it had a contract.

**Free actions:**

**Claim** 

See "Contracts" below.  

**Open** 

You may open any number of qualified, face-down businesses, provided they were neither started nor developed this turn:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the develop cost or...
* If you pay gold cost shown on the card.
* Then you may turn the business face-up and discard the development cards.

**End of turn:**

If you have less than 8 cards, draw 1 from the draw pile.  Each business (opened or not) counts as a card.  The draw pile is the pile of cards from the lowest age.

**End of the Age:**

* Triggered when the last of an age's draw pile is drawn.
* Current player finishes their turn.
* "End of the Age" abilities trigger in turn order starting with the player who ended the age.
* If there's any money in the treasury, the biggest unpaid contract of each player gets paid.  If there isn't enough money in the treasury for this, supplement as needed with money from the supply and cease payouts.  If there's still money in the treasury, repeat.
* Tax comes from each player and from the population (see Population below) and goes into the treasury.  The tax amount is the age that just ended (0-3) plus 1.  This amount is taken from each player.  For each population, the same amount is taken from the supply.  Players who don't have enough pay as much as they can. 

**Contracts:**

* Contracts are awarded during a player's turn to that player.
* Choose one business at a time.  If that business' provisions are all found in the demand pile, the player puts the bottom-most demand card face-down on top of the business.
* Each demand card can count as demand for the icon shown or as demand for weapons (but not both).
* At the end of the age, the owner will earn the contract price from the treasury if there is enough money (see End of the Age).

**Weapons**

* When a weapon business is opened, all weapons two ages older are obsoleted.  That means they are discarded along with their contract.
* Swords obsolete clubs.  Rifles obsolete spears. 

**Discard:**

All discards should be in one face-down pile.  In case of multiple discards, the player discarding decides the order.

**Gold**

Unless the card specifies otherwise, gold gained or lost by abilities or events comes from the supply.

**Population:**

The civ's population is the number of events in the event pile.  Some events increase or decrease population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the top of the event pile.
* To decrease population, resolve the bottom event in the event pile.
* The minimum population is equal to the player count.  If you are at this population and an effect would lose population, ignore it.

**End of Game:**

After the last card of the final draw pile is drawn, players triggering an event may choose not to add a new card to the future event deck.  Continue playing until the events are triggered.  Current player finishes their turn and everyone else gets one more turn.  Trigger EOTA abilities.  Then pay contracts one more time.  No taxes.  The winner is the player with the most money.  Ties are broken by the player with the highest total contract income.

**Icons:**

* Food allows population to grow.  Food businesses generally earn or steal gold directly, even without contracts.
* Science businesses usually help draw more cards.
* Happiness events and demand are generally bad for the civ.  Happiness-providing businesses tend to do well if civ is doing poorly.
* Weapons increase the strength of the civ.  They are easy to find contracts for, but some become obsolete.

**Advanced Game**

* After setup, each player chooses one card, and passes the rest to their left.  Repeat until everyone has chosen 5 cards.
