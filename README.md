v0.7

Treasury is a civ builder where you are a citizen trying to provide what the civ wants while also influencing events.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

On your turn, you can play a card either to start a business (top half) or trigger the current event (bottom half).  After the round is over, you'll earn money for businesses that have a contract.

After an event is resolved, it goes into the demand pile to indicate a resource the civ is now in need of.  These stay here until someone claims them as a contract for their business.

Each business provides a number of resources shown in the top-left.  To earn a contract, the demand pile must have all the resources that a business provides.  If that's the case, the owner may claim the contract on their turn.  Cards with barbarian icons can be optionally considered as demand for weapons instead (clubs, spears, swords, rifles).

**Setup:**

Put 2g for each player into the treasury.  Give 2g to the 1st player, 3g to the 2nd player, etc

With the Age [] cards:
* Deal 5 to each player.
* Put cards equal to the number of players into the current event pile.  Reveal the top card.
* Stack 3 cards per player to form the draw pile.
* Put the remaining Age [] cards away.

With the other cards, separate them by age to make a face-down draw pile for each later age. 


**On your turn**, choose one action:
* Trigger an event
* Start a business
* Develop a business
* Sell a business

**Trigger an event:**
Place a card in the future event pile (this pile starts empty).  This card can come from your hand or from the draw pile.
If there are no cards in the draw pile, you trigger events without playing a new card.
Completely resolve the revealed top card of the current events.  
Then place it in the demand pile.
Reveal the top card from the current event pile.  Or if none are left, the round will end before the starting player's next turn and nobody can play another event this round.

**Start a business:**
Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you. 

**Develop a business:**
Place a card from your hand face-down on top of a face-down business.
On your next turn, you may open the business if it has enough development cards.

**Sell a business:**
Discard a business.  If it was opened, gain gold equal to its gold cost.  Return one of its contract cards to the demand pile and discard the rest.

**Free actions:**

**Open** You may open any number of qualified, face-down businesses:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the develop cost, and it wasn't started or developed this turn. Or...
* If you pay the gold cost...
* Then you may turn the business face-up and discard the development cards.

**Claim** Another free action is to claim a contract.  See "Contracts" below.  

**End of turn:**

If you have less than 8 cards, draw 1 from the draw pile.  Each business (opened or not) counts as a card.

The draw pile is the pile of cards from the lowest age.

**End of Round:**

* Triggered when the last current event has been resolved.  Continue playing until all players have had the same number of turns.
* Deal cards one at a time from the future deck into the current deck (reversing their order).
* "End of the round" abilities trigger in turn order.
* If there's any money in the treasury, the biggest contract of each player gets paid.  If there isn't enough money in the treasury for this, supplement as needed with money from the supply and cease payouts.  Otherwise, repeat.
* Tax comes from each player and from the population (see Population below) and goes into the treasury.  The tax amount is the age (0-3) plus 1 if no happiness is in the demand pile.  This amount is taken from each player.  For each population, the same amount it taken from the supply.  Players who don't have enough pay as much as they can.
* The player providing the most weapons starts the next round.  The tiebreaker is the player having the most of the best weapons among them.  If still tied, the starting player passes left to the next among those tied players.


**Contracts:**

* Contracts are awarded during a player's turn to that player.
* For each business, if that business' provisions are all found in the demand pile, the player takes one demand card with each matching provision, and places them face-down on his business.  
* Barbarian icons can be optionally counted as demand for weapons (but not both weapons and their demand icon).
* At the end of the round, the owner will earn the contract price from the treasury if there is enough money (see End of Round).

**Population:**

The civ's population is the sum of the future and current event deck sizes.  Some events increase or decrease population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the future event deck.
* To decrease population, resolve the next top event from the current event deck.  This may end the round.  If there are no more cards in the current event deck, use the bottom card of the future event deck.
* The minimum population is equal to the player count.  If you are at this population and an effect would lose population, ignore it.

**End of Game:**

When the last card of the final draw pile is drawn, reverse the future events and place them under the current events.  From now on, players triggering an event do not add a new card to the future event deck.  Continue playing until the next end of round.  The winner is the player with the most money. 

**Icons:**

* Food allows population to grow.  Food businesses generally earn or steal gold directly, even without contracts.
* Weapons decrease the strength of the barbarians and help the player go first in the round.
* Science businesses usually help draw more cards.
* Happiness events and demand are generally bad for the civ.  Happiness-providing businesses tend to do well if civ is doing poorly.
* Barbarians weaken the civ.  The number of these in the demand pile is the barbarian strength.  Barbarians also count as weapon demand.
