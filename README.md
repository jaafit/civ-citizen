**Treasury**

Treasury is a civ builder in which you are an entrepreneur instead of a ruler.  You're building a shared civilization with your opponents, competing to provide what's most in demand.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

**Print-and-play**

All files are in the [cards/pdf/](https://github.com/jaafit/treasury/tree/master/cards/pdf) folder. 

These pdfs should be printed single-sided on 8.5"x11" paper.  For the 97 cards, you will need 97 clear plastic sleeves (fitting 2.5"x3.5"), 97 standard-sized playing cards (e.g. MtG 2.5x3.5").  

If you want to sleeve the player aids, you'll need 10 more sleeves and 10 more playing cards.  

In each sleeve, insert one playing card sandwiched by a printed front and matching back.
