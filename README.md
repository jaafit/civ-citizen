**Treasury: Rules**

In Treasury, you are a citizen helping to build a civilization by providing what the civilization wants while also influencing events.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

On your turn, you can play a card either to start a business (top half of the card) or trigger the current event (bottom half).  

After an event is resolved, it goes into the demand pile to indicate a resource the civilization is now in need of.  

Each business provides a number of resources shown in the top-left.  To earn a contract, the demand pile must have all the resources that a business provides.  If that's the case, the owner may claim the contract on their turn.  At the end of each age, they'll earn money for that business.

**Setup:**

Put 2g for each player into the treasury.  Give 2g to the 1st player, 3g to the 2nd player, etc

With the Age [] cards:
* Deal 5 to each player.
* Put cards equal to the number of players into the current event pile.  Reveal the top card.
* Stack 3 cards per player to form the draw pile.
* Put the remaining Age [] cards away.

With the other cards, separate them by age to make a face-down draw pile for each later age. 

**On your turn**, you must choose one action:
* Trigger an event
* Start a business
* Develop a business
* Sell a business

**Trigger an event:**
* Place a card in the future event pile (this pile starts empty).  This card can come from your hand or from the draw pile.
* If there are no cards in the draw pile, you may trigger events without playing a new card.
* Completely resolve the revealed top card of the current events.  Events involving players are resolved in turn order, starting with the current player.
* Then place the event in the demand pile.
* If no current events remain, reverse the future event pile and move it to the current event pile.
* Reveal the top card from the current event pile.  

**Start a business:**
* Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you. 

**Develop a business:**
* Place a card from your hand face-down on top of a face-down business.
* On your next turn, you may open the business if it has enough development cards.

**Sell a business:**
* Discard a business and its contract.  Gain 1g.

**Free actions:**

**Open** 

You may open any number of qualified, face-down businesses, provided they were not started or developed this turn:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the develop cost or...
* If you pay gold cost shown on the card.
* Then you may turn the business face-up and discard the development cards.

**Claim** 

See "Contracts" below.  

**End of turn:**

If you have less than 8 cards, draw 1 from the draw pile.  Each business (opened or not) counts as a card.  The draw pile is the pile of cards from the lowest age.

**End of the Age:**

* Triggered when the last of an age's draw pile is drawn.
* Current player continues playing his turn.
* "End of the Age" abilities trigger in turn order.
* If there's any money in the treasury, the biggest contract of each player gets paid.  If there isn't enough money in the treasury for this, supplement as needed with money from the supply and cease payouts.  If there's still money in the treasury, repeat.
* Tax comes from each player and from the population (see Population below) and goes into the treasury.  The tax amount is the age that just ended (0-3) plus 1 if no happiness is in the demand pile.  This amount is taken from each player.  For each population, the same amount is taken from the supply.  Players who don't have enough pay as much as they can.

**Contracts:**

* Contracts are awarded during a player's turn to that player.
* Choose one business at a time.  If that business' provisions are all found in the demand pile, the player puts the bottom-most out of all matching demand cards face-down on top of the business.
* Each demand card can count as demand for the icon shown or as demand for weapons (but not both).  
* If claiming a contract that includes weapons, take the bottom card from the demand pile.
* At the end of the age, the owner will earn the contract price from the treasury if there is enough money (see End of the Age).

**Discard:**

All discards should be in one face-down pile.  In case of multiple discards, the current player decides the order.

**Gold**

Unless the card specifies otherwise, gold gained or lost by abilities or events comes from the supply.

**Population:**

The civ's population is the sum of the future and current event deck sizes.  Some events increase or decrease population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the future event deck.
* To decrease population, resolve the next top event from the current event deck.  
* The minimum population is equal to the player count.  If you are at this population and an effect would lose population, ignore it.

**End of Game:**

When the last card of the final draw pile is drawn, reverse the future events and place them under the current events.  From now on, players triggering an event do not add a new card to the future event deck.  Continue playing until the events are gone.  Then pay contracts one more time (no taxes) and the winner is the player with the most money.  Ties are broken by the player with the highest total contract income.

**Icons:**

* Food allows population to grow.  Food businesses generally earn or steal gold directly, even without contracts.
* Weapons increase the strength of the civ.
* Science businesses usually help draw more cards.
* Happiness events and demand are generally bad for the civ.  Happiness-providing businesses tend to do well if civ is doing poorly.
