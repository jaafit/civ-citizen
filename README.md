**Treasury: Rules**

In Treasury, you are a citizen helping to build a civilization by providing what the population demands while also influencing events.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

On your turn, you can play a card either to start a business (top half of the card) or play an event (bottom half).  

After an event is resolved, it goes into the demand pile to indicate a resource the civilization is now in need of.  

Each business provides a number of resources shown in the top-left.  To earn a contract, the demand pile must have all the resources that a business provides.  If that's the case, the owner may claim a contract on their turn.  At the end of each age, they'll earn money for each contracted business.

**Setup:**

Put 3 gold per player into the treasury.  Give each player 3 gold.

With the Age [] cards:
* Deal 5 to each player.
* Put cards equal to the number of players minus 1 into the demand pile face-down.  
* Stack 6 cards per player to form the draw pile.  In 4p, only use 5 per player.
* Put the remaining Age [] cards away.

With age I, II, and III cards: 
* Separate them by age, then shuffle each age.
* Form a deck for each age using 5 cards per player in each deck.
* If playing with 4 players, use 4 cards per player instead.

**On your turn**, choose one action:
* Play an event
* Start a business
* Develop a business
* Pass

**Play an event:**
* Place a card face-up on top of the event pile, partially covering the event below.  
* Then place the bottom event card face-up on top of the demand pile.
* Completely resolve the latter event.  Events involving players are resolved in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the current player.

**Start a business:**
* Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you. 

**Develop a business:**
* Place any number of cards from your hand face-down on top of a face-down business.
* On your next turn, you may open the business if it has enough development cards.
* The development cost is shown in the bottom-right corner of the business (the first number).

**Pass**
* Play an event from the draw pile.  
* If there is no draw pile, move the bottom event to the demand queue and resolve it.


**Free actions:**

**Claim a Contract** 

See "Contracts" below.  

**Open a business** 

You may open any number of qualified, face-down businesses, provided they were neither started nor developed this turn:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the develop cost or...
* If you pay gold cost shown in the bottom-right corner of the business (the second number).
* Then you may turn the business face-up, trigger any "open" abilities, then discard the development cards.

**Close a business:**

* Discard a business and its contract.  Gain any gold that was on its contract.
* You may not close a business that was started this turn.

**First Turn**

On your first turn, you must help create the event queue.  Do do this, you play a card from your hand as an event.  This goes into the event queue face-up, and does not trigger an event.  When everyone has done this, the event queue will have one card for each player.  It will remain this way until the _End of Game_.  

**End of turn:**

If you have less than 8 cards, draw 1 from the draw pile.  Each business (opened or not) counts as a card.  The draw pile is the pile of cards from the lowest-numbered age.

**End of Age:**

* Triggered when the last of an age's draw pile is drawn.
* Current player finishes their turn.
* "End of Age" abilities trigger in turn order starting with the player who ended the age.
* If there's any money in the treasury, the biggest unpaid contract of each player gets paid from the treasury.  Place the gold on the contract to mark it as paid.  If there isn't enough money in the treasury for this, supplement as needed with money from the supply and cease payouts.  If there's still money in the treasury, repeat.  
* Move all money on contracts into their owner's pool.
* Tax comes from each player and from the population (see Population below) and goes into the treasury.  The tax amount for players is the age that just ended (0-3) plus 1.  This amount is taken from each player.  Players who don't have enough pay as much as they can. 
* Tax also comes from the population.  Count all contracts and all non-happy cards in the demand pile.  This amount comes from the supply.

**Contracts:**

* Contracts are awarded to a business during its owner's turn.
* Choose one business at a time.  If that business' provisions are all found face-up in the demand pile, the player puts the bottom-most demand card face-down on top of the business, covering the bottom half.  
* You may examine your own contracts at any time.
* The business's ability is still active.
* Each demand card icon can count as demand for the icon shown or as demand for a weapon (but not both).
* At the end of age, the owner will earn the contract price from the treasury if there is enough money (see End of Age).

**Weapons**

* When a weapon business is opened, all weapons two ages older are obsoleted.  That means their contract is discarded.  Gold on the contract is given to the owner.
* Axes obsolete clubs.  Swords obsolete spears and clubs.
* Businesses providing obsoleted weapons can no longer be contracted.

**Discard:**

All discards should be in one face-down pile.  In case of multiple discards, the player discarding decides the order.

**Gold**

Unless specified otherwise, gold gained or lost comes from the supply.  Treasury gold is generally only used for contracts.

**Population:**

The civ's population is the number of demand cards plus the number of contracts.  Some events increase or decrease population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the demand pile.  If it was not happy demand, add 1 gold to treasury.
* To decrease population, discard the bottom card of the demand pile.

**End of Game:**

After the last card of the final draw pile is drawn, players who choose to pass will trigger the bottom event of the event queue without adding a new event.  Continue playing until the last event is triggered this way.  The player doing this finishes their turn and everyone else gets one more turn.  Process another End of Age but with no taxes.  The winner is the player with the most money.  Ties are broken by the player with the highest total contract income.

**Icons:**

* Food events cause the population to grow.  Food businesses give extra actions, but tend to drain your hand of cards.
* Science businesses and events draw more cards.
* Food and science together form a great combination.   
* Happiness events are barbarians, which drain the treasury.  Happiness-providing businesses tend to do well if civ is doing poorly.  They make money without the need for contracts.
* Weapons increase the strength of the civ.  They are easy to find contracts for, but some become obsolete.  They do well if the treasury is low.  
* Age-specific resources tend to have high contracts, but weak abilities.  They do well when the treasury is low but not empty. 

**Advanced Game**

* After setup, each player chooses one card, and passes the rest to their left.  Repeat until everyone has chosen 5 cards.
