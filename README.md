v0.7

Treasury is a civ builder where you are a citizen trying to provide what the civ wants while also influencing events.  You'll open businesses that give you unique abilities and earn money from the treasury.  After all the cards and events are drawn, the winner is the player with the most money.

Setup:

Put 2g for each player into the treasury.  Give 2g to the 1st player, 3g to the 2nd player, etc

With the Age [] cards:
* Deal 5 to each player
* Put cards equal to the number of players into the current event pile.  Reveal the top card.
* Stack 3 cards per player to form the Age [] deck.
* Put the remaining Age [] cards into the box

On your turn, you can play a card either to start a business (top half) or trigger the current event (bottom half).  After all current events have been triggered, the round is over and you'll earn money for businesses that have a contract.

After an event is resolved, it goes into the demand pile to indicate a resource the civ is now in need of.  These stay here until someone claims them as a contract for their business.

Each business provides a number of resources shown in the top-left.  To earn a contract, the civ must demand all the resources that a business provides.  If that's the case, the owner may claim the contract on their turn.  Cards with barbarian icons can be optionally considered demand for weapons instead (clubs, spears, swords, rifles).

**On your turn**, choose one action:
* Seed an event
* Start a business
* Develop a business
* Sell a business

**Seed an event:**
Place a card in the future event pile.  This card can come from your hand or from the draw pile.
If there are no cards in the draw pile, you may trigger the revealed event without seeding a new one.
Resolve the revealed top card of the current events.
Place it in the demand pile.
Reveal top card from the current event pile.  Or if none are left, the round will end before the starting player's next turn and nobody can play another event this round.

**Start a business:**
Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you.  If you pay its gold cost, you may place it face-up (opened) instead.
If you don't want to pay the gold cost, you can...

**Develop a business:**
Place a card from your hand face-down on top of a startup.
You cannot open this business this turn.
On your next turn, you may open the business if it has enough development cards.

**Sell a business:**
Discard a business.  If it was opened, gain gold equal to its gold cost.  Return one of its contract cards to the demand pile and discard the rest.

**Free actions:**

You may open any number of qualified, face-down businesses:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the develop cost, or you pay the gold cost, you may turn the business face-up and discard the develop cards.
* This does not count as an action.
* You may not open a business that was developed this turn.
Another free action is to claim a contract.  Take all the cards the business provides, and place them face-down on the business.

During your turn, claim any contracts you have earned.

**End of turn:**
If you have less than 8 cards, draw 1.  Each business (opened or not) counts as a card.


**End of Round:**

* Triggered when the last current event has been resolved.
* Deal cards one at a time from the future deck into the current deck (reversing their order).
* "End of the round" abilities trigger.
* If there's any money in the treasury, the biggest contract of each player gets paid.  If there isn't enough money in the treasury for this, supplement as needed with money from the supply and payouts cease.  Otherwise repeat.
* Tax amount is the age (0-3) gold plus 1 if no happiness is in the demand pile.  This amount is taken from the supply for each population, and from each player.
* Players who cannot pay, pay as much as you can.
* The player providing the most weapons starts the next round.  Tiebreaker is the most of the best weapons among them.  If still tied, the starting player passes left to the next tied player.


**Contract:**

* Contracts are awarded during a player's turn to that player.
* For each business, if that business' provisions are all found in the demand pile, the player takes one demand card with each matching provision, and places them face-down on his business.
* Barbarian icons can be optionally counted as demand for weapons (but not both weapons and their demand icon).
* At the end of the round, the owner will earn the contract price from the treasury if there is enough money (see End of Round).

**Population:**

The civ's population is the sum of the future and current event deck sizes.  Some events increase or decrease population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the future event deck.
* To decrease population, reveal and resolve the top card from the current event deck.  This may end the round.  If there are no cards in the current event deck, reveal and resolve the bottom card of the future event deck.
* The minimum population is equal to the player count.  If you are at this population and an effect would lose population, ignore it.

**Icons:**

* Food allows population to grow.  Owners earn or steal gold directly, even w/o contract.
* Weapons increase the str of civ and help the player act first in the round.
* Science businesses usually help draw more cards.
* Happiness events and demand are generally bad for the civ.  Happiness-providing businesses tend to do well if civ is doing poorly.
* Barbarians weaken the civ.  The number of these in the demand pile is the barbarian strength.  It also doubles as weapon demand.

**End of Game:**

The end of the game is triggered when the last event is resolved.  Play until everyone has had the same number of turns, then go through one last end of round sequence.
