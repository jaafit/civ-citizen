Components:
7 ages of cards
gold tokens

Cards are simultaneously events, businesses, and investments.  Events influence the civ.  Businesses give their owner bonuses, provide resources, and can be contracted by the civ. Investments are used to help build businesses.

On your turn, either: (2 actions?)
* Seed an event
* Start a business
* Invest in a business

Seed an event
Place a card in the future event pile.  Draw a card.  Reveal a card from the current event pile.  Place it face up on the current event row.  If this is the last card in the pile, the round is over.

Start a business:
Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you.  If its investment cost is zero or you pay its gold cost, place it face-up instead.

Invest in a business:
* Place a card face-down on top of a startup, then draw a card.  If the number of cards matches the investment cost, turn the business face-up, discarding all investments.
* OR pay the business's gold cost (regardless of previous investment) and turn the business over.

Business Tax:
When a business is turned face-up, put gold equal to its gold cost from the supply into the treasury.

End of Round:
* Civ collects taxes.  1 gold per population, plus 1 per player.
* If the barbarians are stronger than the civ, they take 1 gold per strength difference.
* If the civ produces more food than its pop size and the barbarians did not take gold, it increases pop by 1.
* Contracted businesses pay their contract amt from treasury.  Payouts start with contracts of the latest age.  If this depletes the treasury, continue paying out from bank.  Then if any money left, repeat with older businesses.
* Players may optionally close one business
* Resolve events in order.  After resolving the first event, add it to the demand pile.  If any uncontracted building now provides the same resources as any subset of the demand pile, it gets a contract.
* Deal cards one at a time from the future deck into the current deck (reversing their order).

Contract:
* After a card is added to the demand pile, if some of what's demanded is provided by a business, that business owner takes as many cards from the demand as will meet what his business provides, places one face-down on his business, discards the rest.
* Ties are broken by who provides the best weapons.  If tied, the most weapons.  If tied, nobody gets it yet.

Population:
The civ's population is the size of the future and current event decks.  Some events increase/decrease population.  Population is increased by 1 at the end of the round if the total food provided by all businesses is great than the population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the future event deck.  To decrease population, reveal a card from the current event deck.

Icons:
Food allows population to grow as described above.
Weapons increase str of civ, break contract ties.

Barbarians:
* Some cards have a barbarian icon.  The number of these in the demand pile is the barbarian strength.
