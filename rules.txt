Setup:
5g 1st player, 6g 2nd player, etc
5g treasury
[playercount] cards face-down in current event pile (population is [playercount])

On your turn, either:
* Seed an event
* Start a business
* Invest in a business

Seed an event
Place a card in the future event pile.  Draw a card.  Reveal a card from the current event pile.  Place it face up on the current event row.  If this is the last card in the pile, the round is over.

Start a business:
Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you.

Invest in a business:
* Place a card face-down on top of a startup, then draw a card.

At the beginning of your turn (before action) you may finish any number of businesses:
* If the number of cards on a face-down business matches the investment cost, you may turn the business face-up.
* Discard the investments.
* OR you may pay the business's gold cost (regardless of previous investment) and turn the business over.  This is not an action.

Business Tax:
When a business is turned face-up, put gold equal to its gold cost from the supply into the treasury.

End of Round:
* Civ collects taxes.  [age] gold per population, plus [age] gold from each player.  Players who cannot pay, pay as much as you can.
* If the barbarians are stronger than the civ, they take [age] gold per strength difference from treasury.
* If the civ produces more food than its pop size and the barbarians did not take gold, increase pop by 1.
* Contracted businesses pay their contract amt from treasury.  Payouts start with contracts of the latest age.  If this depletes the treasury, continue paying out from supply.  Then if any money left, repeat with older businesses.
* Players may optionally close one business.  Put it in your hand.
* Deal cards one at a time from the future deck into the current deck (reversing their order).
* Resolve events in order.  After resolving the first event, add it to the demand pile.  If any uncontracted building now provides the same resources as any subset of the demand pile, put one of these demand cards face-down on the business and discard the rest.
* The poorest player starts the next round.  If tied, then play starts with to the left of the last player to act.

Contract:
* After a card is added to the demand pile, if some of what's demanded is provided by a business, that business owner takes as many cards from the demand as will meet what his business provides, places one face-down on his business, discards the rest.  If he has two businesses that qualify, he may choose which one closes first.
* If tied, the best weapon decides.  If tied, the most weapons decides.  If tied, nobody gets it yet.
* Once a business is contracted, it loses its abilities, but at the end of the round, its owner will earn the contract price from the treasury.

Population:
The civ's population is the size of the future and current event decks.  Some events increase/decrease population.  Population is increased by 1 at the end of the round if the total food provided by all businesses is great than the population.
* To increase population, draw a card and add it to the future event deck.
* To decrease population, reveal a card from the current event deck.  This may end the round.

Icons:
Food allows population to grow as described above.
Weapons increase str of civ, break contract ties.

Barbarians:
* Some cards have a barbarian icon.  The number of these in the demand pile is the barbarian strength.

Ages:
There are 6 ages.  Each age has a set of resources in demand and provided by businesses.  Most resources are only found in two or three ages.  Their buildings cannot be contracted after their age has passed.  Food, happiness, and science are found in all ages.  These businesses tend to have better effects, but are always under threat of being contracted.
